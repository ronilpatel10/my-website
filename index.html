    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <h3>Ronil Patel</h3>
    <p>Hello, fellow classmates, teachers, and anyone reading this. My name is Ronil, but I also have a few nicknames like "sexy guy," "Mr. Handsome," and the list goes on. Okay, yeah, sorry for my corny joke, haha. But you can also call me Ron, Ro, Ronnie, Ronezy, or Tadoeâ€”whatever floats your boat. You're probably wondering where I got the last nickname from, and it originated when I was younger, playing AAU basketball. The story behind it is quite lengthy, so feel free to ask if you're curious. Basketball holds a special place in my heart, as it was my first love. The game itself is incredibly beautiful, and the skills it entails are truly captivating. Basketball has had a profound impact on my life, and I can't even fathom where I would be without it. Through basketball, I've made lifelong friends, cherished countless memories, and learned invaluable lessons in discipline. It has taught me so much beyond the sport itself. For instance, teamwork is a crucial aspect of basketball, essential for building a strong team and achieving victories. This skill extends beyond the court and can be applied to various aspects of life, such as work, family, and more. Witnessing a group working together harmoniously and accomplishing their desired goals is truly inspiring.</p>

    <p>I was born in Parsippany, New Jersey, and from there, I moved back and forth between New York and New Jersey. When I turned four, I relocated to Tennessee, and at the age of six, I settled in South Carolina, where I spent the rest of my childhood. Now, at 23 years old, I have recently returned to New Jersey with the intention of pursuing a career in software engineering through the Flatiron program.</p>
        
    <p>My decision to enroll in Flatiron came after visiting my uncle in Florida, where I had the opportunity to see his company and shadow their software engineers. Observing them in action and witnessing their tasks intrigued me greatly. As someone who has always had a passion for technology, seeing it come to life through coding fascinated me. People often appreciate the end products like cool websites and games, but many fail to realize that all of that is made possible through coding! The beauty of watching code run seamlessly in your terminal and successfully passing all the tests is incredibly satisfying to me. As a natural problem solver, I felt that a career in software engineering would be the perfect fit for me. </p>
  <h4>Life changing</h4> <p>
I wanted to share this photo because it captures a meaningful moment from my recent visit to India, which was also my first time traveling outside of my country. During my trip, I had the opportunity to meet a lady through my grandpa. She worked at a temple near our location, and one day, we went for a walk together. During that time, we engaged in a deep, spiritual conversation about life, and it truly touched my heart. Being of Indian origin, this trip allowed me to experience life in India firsthand and appreciate the stark differences in living conditions compared to what I have here. It made me profoundly grateful for the life I have. Witnessing the Indian culture up close was incredibly fascinating, and it prompted me to be fully present in the moment, spending less time on my phone. The specific area I visited was Tarapur, a town in the state of Gujarat, India. It was there that I discovered new friends and family members I never knew existed before. That area is not as modern comapred to other places around the world, but I was glad I got to experience that type of lifestlye of not being so privlaged, but I also did get to see modern areas as well like Mumbai. After all the incredible experiences and returning from that month-long journey, I found myself much happier and experiencing significant personal growth. I will provide a link to a video that showcases some highlights from my trip below too.

Kanye's track captures the essence of achieving one's dreams and the accompanying emotions. J. Cole's song emphasizes the importance of appreciating and loving one's own life. It reminds us that true happiness can only be found by embracing and being content with what we have, rather than yearning for someone else's life.. </li>
